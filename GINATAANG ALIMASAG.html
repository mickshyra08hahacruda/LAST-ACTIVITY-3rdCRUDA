<p>The phrase “Ginataang Alimasag” refers to crabs cooked in sweet, tasty coconut milk. Filipinos love anything with gata or coconut milk –– you could say we go nuts for coconuts! It’s one of our most abundant produce, especially since we live in a tropical country. We love coconut juice at the end of a long day because of its refreshing flavor. The “meat” you can scrape from its shell makes for an additional treat! But gata and its warm, sweet, nutty flavor is always a sure favorite with whatever meat, seafood, or veggies you choose to pair it with.</p>
