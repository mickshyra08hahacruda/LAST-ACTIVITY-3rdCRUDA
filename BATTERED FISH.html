<p>Beer Battered Fish are fish fillets coated in fish batter and deep fried until golden brown. I used tilapia fillets for this recipe, but you can always use other fish varieties. The reason why I chose tilapia has something to do with availability and cost. The fish batter recipe uses beer as its main ingredient. It gives the batter a nice flavor.</p>
